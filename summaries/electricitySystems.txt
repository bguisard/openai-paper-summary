AI has the potential to drastically change the electricity industry by reducing emissions, improving forecasts, and optimizing management.
-Low-carbon electricity sources are essential to tackling climate change, and ML can help improve necessary technologies and create advanced electricity markets.
-Many system operators today use basic forecasting techniques, but forecasts will need to become increasingly accurate to support the use of variable sources.
-ML can help improve short- to medium-term forecasts by incorporating domain-specific insights and directly optimizing for system goals.
Scientists are using machine learning to improve the forecasting of solar power, wind power, hydro power, and electricity demand. 
-Some work has focused on understanding specific categories of demand, for instance by clustering households or by disaggregating electricity signals using game theory, optimization, regression, and/or online learning. 
-In order to improve forecasting, ML algorithms of the future will need to incorporate domain-specific insights. For instance, since weather fundamentally drives both variable generation and electricity demand, ML algorithms forecasting these quantities should draw from innovations in climate modeling and weather forecasting. 
-In addition to incorporating system physics, ML models should also directly optimize for system goals. For instance, the authors of one study use a deep neural network to produce demand forecasts that optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast accuracy. 
-When balancing electricity systems, system operators use a process called unit commitment to determine how much power every controllable generator should produce. This process is slow and complex, as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such as the knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem that must be coordinated across multiple time scales (from sub-second to days ahead). 
-ML can help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch by speeding up power system optimization problems and improving the quality of optimization solutions. 
-A great deal of work primarily in optimization, but also using techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic, has focused on improving the tractability of power system optimization problems. 
-Dynamic scheduling and safe reinforcement learning could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some electricity system operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales. 
-While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has examined how to (at least partially) decentralize scheduling and dispatch using energy storage, flexible demand, low-carbon generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid. 
-In general, much more work is needed to test and scale existing decentralized solutions; barring deployment on real systems, platforms such as PowerTAC can provide large-scale simulated electricity markets on which to perform these tests.
ML could be used to approximate or simplify existing optimization problems, to find good starting points for optimization, or to learn from the actions of power system control engineers.
-Dynamic scheduling and safe reinforcement learning could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some electricity system operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales.
-While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has examined how to (at least partially) scheduling and dispatch using energy storage, flexible demand, low-carbon generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid.
-One strategy is to explicitly design local control algorithms; for instance, recent work has controlled energy storage and using supervised learning techniques trained on historical optimization data.
-Another strategy is to let storage, demand, and generation respond to real-time prices that reflect (for example) how emissions-intensive electricity currently is. In this case, ML can help both to design real-time prices and to respond to these prices.
-Previous work has used dynamic programming to set real-time electricity prices and reinforcement learning to set real-time prices in more general settings; similar techniques could be applied to create prices that instead optimize for GHG emissions.
-Techniques such as agent-based models, online optimization, and dynamic programming can then help maximize profits for decentralized storage, demand, and generation, given real-time prices.
-In general, much more work is needed to test and scale existing decentralized solutions; barring deployment on real systems, platforms such as PowerTAC can provide large-scale simulated electricity markets on which to perform these tests.
-Scientists are working to develop new materials that can better store or otherwise harness energy from variable natural resources. For instance, creating (synthetic fuels produced from sunlight or solar heat) could allow us to capture solar energy when the sun is shining and then store this energy for later use.
-However, the process of discovering new materials can be slow and imprecise; the physics behind materials are not completely understood, so human experts often manually apply heuristics to understand a proposed material's physical properties. ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics with experimental data, physics, and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge.
-For instance, recent work has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics to figure out a proposed material's crystal structure, with the goal of accelerating materials discovery for solar fuels.
-Other work seeking to
There are many opportunities for machine learning (ML) to improve variable power generation from sources such as solar and wind.
-Prior work has used reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization to control movable solar panels or wind turbine blades in order to maximize electricity production.
-Other work has used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels or genetic algorithms to optimally place wind turbines within a wind farm.
-ML can also help control batteries located at solar and wind farms to increase these farms' profits, for instance by storing their electricity when prices are low and then selling it when prices are high.
-Rooftop solar panels are often connected to the electric grid, which traditionally did not have many sensors because it was only used to deliver electricity from centralized power plants to consumers.
-However, recent work has employed techniques such as matrix completion and deep neural networks to estimate the state of the system when there are few sensors.
-Controllable low-carbon electricity sources can help achieve climate change goals while requiring very few changes to how the electric grid is run.
-ML can support existing controllable technologies while accelerating the development of new technologies such as nuclear fusion power plants.
-Many controllable low-carbon technologies are already commercially available; these technologies include geothermal, nuclear fission, and (in some cases) dam-based hydropower.
-ML can provide valuable input in planning where these technologies should be deployed and can also help maintain already-operating power plants.
-For instance, recent work has proposed to use ML to identify and manage sites for geothermal energy, using satellite imagery and seismic data.
-Nuclear fusion reactors have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free electricity using a virtually limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy than they produce.
-While considerable scientific and engineering research is still needed, ML can help accelerate this work by guiding experimental design and monitoring physical processes.
-Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental design because they have a large number of tunable parameters; ML can help prioritize which parameter configurations should be explored during physical experiments.
-Physically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML.
-More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists need to understand how plasma's state evolves over time; ML could help characterize this evolution and even help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control.
-ML models for such fusion applications would likely employ a combination of simulated and experimental data, and would need to account for
Google and TAE Technologies have developed an algorithm that uses machine learning (ML) to enable rapid parameter exploration for TAE's fusion reactor. 
-Physically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML. 
-Modern reactors attempt to super-heat hydrogen into a plasma state and then stabilize it, but during this process, the plasma may experience rapid instabilities that damage the reactor. 
-Prior work has tried to preemptively detect disruptions for reactors, using supervised learning methods such as support-vector machines, adaptive fuzzy logic, decision trees, and deep learning on previous disruption data. 
-While many of these methods are tuned to work on individual reactors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights that generalize to multiple reactors. 
-More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists need to understand how plasma's state evolves over time, e.g. by finding the solutions of time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic equations; speculatively, ML could help characterize this evolution and even help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. 
-ML models for such fusion applications would likely employ a combination of simulated and experimental data, and would need to account for the different physical characteristics, data volumes, and simulator speeds or accuracies associated with different reactor types. 
-While switching to low-carbon electricity sources will be essential, in the meantime, it will also be important to mitigate emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands. 
-Some methods for mitigating current-system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels, reducing waste from electricity delivery, and flexibly managing demand to minimize its emissions impacts. 
-Reducing emissions from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions towards low-carbon electricity. 
-In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane (an extremely potent greenhouse gas) from natural gas pipelines and compressor stations. 
-Previous and ongoing work has used sensor and/or satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance or detect existing leaks, and there is a great deal of opportunity in this space to improve and scale existing strategies. 
-In addition to leak detection, ML can help reduce emissions from freight transportation of solid fuels, identify and manage storage sites for carbon sequestered from power plant flue gas, and optimize power plant parameters to reduce emissions. 
-In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great care so as not to impede or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity system; ideally,
WattTime uses regression-based techniques to estimate marginal emissions factors in real time for the United States, and the electricityMap project provides multi-day forecasts for Europe using ensemble models on electricity and weather data.
-Great Britain's National Grid ESO also uses ensemble models to forecast emissions factors, which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of all power plants.
-There is still much room to improve the performance of these methods, as well as to forecast related quantities such as electricity curtailments (i.e.~the wasting of usually low-carbon electricity for grid balancing purposes).
-As most existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed decrease (rather than increase) emissions.
-Much of the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such as the United States with near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data. However, many places that do not share these attributes are still integral to tackling climate change and warrant serious consideration.
-To ensure global impact, ML can help improve electricity access and translate electricity system insights from high-data to low-data contexts.
-Improving access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously improving social and economic development. Specifically, clean electricity provided via electric grids, , or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators, wood-burning stoves, and other carbon-emitting energy sources.
-Figuring out what clean electrification methods are best for different areas can require intensive, boots-on-the-ground surveying work, but ML can help provide input to this process in a scalable manner.
-For instance, previous work has used image processing, clustering, and optimization techniques on satellite imagery to inform electrification initiatives.
-ML and statistics can also help operate rural microgrids through accurate forecasts of demand and power production, since small microgrids are even harder to balance than country-scale electric grids.
-Generating data to aid energy access policy and better managing energy access strategies are therefore two areas in which ML may have promising applications.
-While ML methods have often been applied to grids with widespread sensors, system operators in many countries do not collect or share system data. Although these data availability practices may evolve, it may meanwhile be beneficial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning to translate insights from high-data to low-data settings (especially since all electric grids share the same underlying system physics).
